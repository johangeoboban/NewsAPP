# NewsAPP
World news at your fingertips.<br />

Developed with Java<br />
## OVERVIEW<br />
This app shows you the latest news from many different places, talking about different things.<br />
We use NewsAPI.org to get the news.<br />
If you pick a news place (like CNN or Time), you can see up to 10 of their top stories.<br />
If you choose a topic, you'll only see news sources that talk about that topic.<br />
You can read the news by swiping right for the next story or left for the previous one.<br />
